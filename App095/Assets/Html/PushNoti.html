Instead of robbing you of your confidence and drive, anxiety can actually motivate and excite you. The following exercise demonstrates a simple way to handle the nervous energy you feel. <br>  <br> When you feel anxious, accept the way you are feeling in that moment. Instead of getting upset by the anxiety, decide to turn it to your advantage. You can turn your nervous energy into excitement and stimulation by pretending you have just finished a strong cup of coffee! Just like caffeine, anxiety stimulates your nervous system. Under its influence your mind is more alert and your body is primed for action, so why not take advantage of all that extra energy buzzing around your system and pretend it is simply the result of a caffeine kick? (http://bit.ly/coffeeexerscie) <br>  <br> If you wake feeling anxious don‚Äôt analyze the way you feel, rather decide to let the nervous energy become your new kick-start to the day. Feel how alive and alert your body and mind are because of the anxiety. Now make the most of that nervous energy and use it to drive your day forward. <br>  <br> You could go exercise, clean the house, or get that report written. Do anything at all to channel that energy into something constructive. What you must not do is turn that energy inwards and worry about it. Turing inwards and analyzing the way you feel only creates more anxiety. Instead, push the energy outwards and move with it. Work in tandem with the nervous energy and what you will find is that it quickly transforms from feelings of fear into excitement. <br>  <br> Why do you think Woody Allen is so creative? He puts all of his nervous energy to great use by being creative. You can, too, by turning what is normally an uncomfortable feeling into a force of motivation and action. <br>  <br> So the next time you feel anxious, simply pretend you have just had a big cup of coffee and then channel that nervous energy to your advantage. This exercise is another example of how a small change in perception can transform the way your anxiety feels. <br>  <br> Credit for the exercise goes to our Panic Away forum moderator, Kasey.

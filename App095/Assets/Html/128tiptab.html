    </div><hr><div align="justify"><p>How many times have you arrived in Paris for a leisurely visit, 
suddenly paralyzed by a well known tourist trauma known simply as: Fear 
of French. The FOF antidote is relatively painless and as accessible as 
an mp3 player or iPod (make that eePod if you want to pronounce it 
correctly in French.) </p>
<p>In the last two years, a small online industry has bloomed that 
offers free, practical podcasts in the French language targeting 
beginners to advanced students. My favorites are short lessons to cope 
with practical situations from a dental visit to making reservations at a
 swank restaurant. But I also like the podcasts that offer quick 
postcard stories about life in France. The lessons make long flights or 
train rides into swift commutes. </p>
<p>A sampling: </p>

These free podcasts are clear, professional and extremely practical with
 explanations in English and French about coping with the daily routines
 of life. The lessons tend to be aimed at intermediate to advanced 
French students. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rfi.fr/lffr/statiques/accueil_apprendre.asp"><font color="#0000FF">RFI français facile</font></a>,
 daily news and headlines from France that are delivered in slow mode by
 the international French broadcaster. RFI also offers exercises and 
vocabulary to improve comprehension. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.podcastfrancaisfacile.com/"><font color="#0000FF">Français Facile</font></a> 
is a Web site from “Vincent” offering daily podcasts aimed at students 
from beginners to advanced. You’ll find the basics here, but also can 
explore eclectic topics from making a crepe to stirring up squash soup.</p>

 I adore this Web site because of its snapshots of French life delivered
 by “Laeticia” who gives two to three minute snippets of her daily life 
from losing her favorite neighborhood butcher to watching the patterns 
of swallows circling by her baby’s window. </p><br><br><br>Collected by Best Apps for Phone Team<br><br><a href="12TIPSTAB.html"><font size="2"><font size="2"><font color="#CC0000">Back to Menu &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></font></font></a><br><br><a href="129tiptab.html"><font color="#CC0000">Read next tip &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></a><br></div>
